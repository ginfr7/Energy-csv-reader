# Energy-csv-reader
Project created in Python as an exercise. Given the mass, velocity and height of each particle on a .csv file, it calculates the energy of the system.
The program can be easily updated to fit every kind of .csv data, since the main functions for reading and ordering info on dictionaries are created.
